		<u><b>Ionic Bonding</b></u>
		<ul>Ionic bonding involves the<b style="color:#FF0000;"> transfer</b> of electrons from one atom to another in order to satisfy the <b style="color:#FF0000;">octet</b> rule. (8 valence electrons)</ul>
		<ul>Positively charged <b style="color:#FF0000;">cations</b> and negatively charged <b style="color:#FF0000;">anions</b> serve as the glue that holds the atoms together in an ionic bond.</ul>
		<ul>Ionic bonds/compounds can be modeled with<b style="color:#FF0000;"> Lewis Dot diagrams.</b></ul> 
		<u><b><ul>Dol</ul></b></u>
		<ul>Ionic Compounds are composed of cations and anions. They hold the ionic bond together with the attraction of opposite charges.</ul>
<u><big>Lewis Dots for Ions</u></big>
<ul>	EQ: What are the similarities and differences in the Lewis Dot diagrams for atoms molecules and ions?</ul>
<u><b><ul>Ions v. neutral atoms</ul></b></u>
<ul>Positive ions LOSE electrons, so their Lewis Dots will have less electrons than a neutral atom.</ul>
<ul>Negative ions gain electrons, so their Lewis Dots will have more electrons than the neutral atom. </ul>
<u><b><ul>STEPS for drawing Lewis Dot diagrams for Ionic Compounds:</ul></b></u>
		<ul>1.Write the Lewis Dot (LD) for each ion.</ul>
		<ul>2.Draw arrows to show the transfer of  electron(s) from the cation to the anion, so that they both achieve full and stable energy levels.</ul> 
                <ul> 3. The final dot diagram shows Cation with 0 valence electrons (dots) and a positive charge, and Anion with 8 valence electrons (dots) and a negative charge.</ul>
		<ul>4.Write each ion in brackets and the charges outside of the brackets.</ul>
		<ul>5.IF there are more than one cation or anion, write that number to the left & outside of the brackets.</ul>
