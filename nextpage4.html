		<ul><u>Polarity</u>when one atom (pole) in a bond attracts (pulls) electrons more towards </ul>
		<ul><u>itself,</u> creating slightly UNBALANCED + and – charges within the molecule.</ul>
		<ul><u>ELECTRONEGATIVITY =</u>the value that represents how much an element attracts electrons </ul>
		<ul>Higher electronegativity means more pull towards that atom</ul>
<ul>The polarity of a bond is determined by the difference between the electronegativities of the elements within the bond.</ul>
		<ul>Nonpolar Covalent: 0 - 0.5 electronegativity difference</ul>
		<ul> Polar Covalent:0.6 – 1.6 electronegativity difference</ul>
		<ul>Ionic:1.7 + electronegativity difference(IONIC BONDS ARE THE MOST POLAR!)</ul>
		<ul>Nonpolar Covalent:  Share electrons equally</ul>
		<ul>Polar Covalent: Share electrons unequally </ul>
		<ul>Ionic: Transfer electrons </ul>
		<ul>Determining Polarity – 3. Molecular Shape</ul>
		<ul>Nonpolar Covalent:  Shapes are SYMMETRIC!</ul>
		<ul>Polar Covalent:NONSYMMETRIC due to lone pairs</ul>
		<ul>Nonpolar Covalent:  NEAR (almost right next to each other) each other on the periodic table</ul>
		<ul>Polar Covalent:A LITTLE farther apart on the periodic table (1-2 groups apart)</ul>
		<ul> ionic one from each side</ul>

		<ul><u>Eq:whats's the difference between physical and chemical changes?</u></ul>
		<ul><u>physical change</u></ul>
		<ul>Atoms do not rearrange</ul>
		<ul>only physical properties change chemical properties do not</ul>
		<ul> physical changes are generally easy to reverse</ul>
		<ul>No energy is produced by the substance.</ul>
		<ul><u>Chemical change</u></ul>
		<ul>Atoms are rearranged into different molecules</ul>
		<ul>Both physical and chemical properties are changed</ul>
		<ul> changes are not reversible without another reaction </ul>
		<ul>energy is easily produced</ul>
		<ul><big><u>Evidence of chemical reactions</u></big></ul>
		<ul> 1. unexpected color change</ul>
		<ul> a color change is often a sign that a chemical reaction has occured</ul>
		<ul> 2. precipitate</ul>
		<ul> when a solid forms from a solution</ul>
		<ul> 3. Gas production</ul>
		<ul> anytime a gas is produced a chemical reaction has occured boiling does not count</ul>
		<ul> 4.changes in temperature</ul>
		<ul>exothermic reaction a reaction that releases energy in the form of heat</ul>
		<ul> endothermic reaction a reaction that absorbs energy and becomes cooler</ul>
		<ul>5.production of light</ul>
