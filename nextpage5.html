    <ul> take the lowest stig fig and use it</ul>
		<big><u> Unit 5 gasses </u></big>
			 <ul> Eq: What is kinetic theory of molecules and how how does it relate to the behavior of gases?</ul>
		<ul> The theory is based upon the movement speed of solids, liquid, gasses </ul>
		<ul> Kinetic Theory of molecules the study of molecules and their behavior in all states of matter (solid, liquid, and gasses)</ul>
		<ul> 1. All matter is composed of small particles called atoms or molecules </ul>
		<ul> 2. These particles are constantly in motion </ul>
		<ul> 3. All collisions between particles are perfectly elastic( which means there is no loss of energy when they hit) </ul>
