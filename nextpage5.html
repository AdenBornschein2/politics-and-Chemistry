		<big><u> Unit 5 gasses </u></big>
			 <ul> Eq: What is kinetic theory of molecules and how how does it relate to the behavior of gases?</ul>
		<ul> The theory is based upon the movement speed of solids, liquid, gasses </ul>
		<ul> Kinetic Theory of molecules the study of molecules and their behavior in all states of matter (solid, liquid, and gasses)</ul>
		<ul> 1. All matter is composed of small particles called atoms or molecules </ul>
		<ul> 2. These particles are constantly in motion </ul>
		<ul> 3. All collisions between particles are perfectly elastic( which means there is no loss of energy when they hit) </ul>
		<ul> Eq: how do temperature, pressure and volume relate to gas behavior</ul>
		<ul> What is happening with the container is that the light species starts to remove itself</ul>
		<ul> I noticed the temp started increasing faster and the pressure started to rise but the light species stayed relativly the same</ul>
		<ul> I noticed the species started to decrease in speed but we had relativly the same amount of species</ul>
		<ul> the general rule is that if you increase tempature gas molecules will increase speed decrease tempature they will start to slow down</ul>
		<ul> If there is to much presure it pops off and if it is to cold it pops off and if it is to hot it pops off thats what the lid does</ul>
		<ul> our first prediction of the heat was proven right because of the heat and pressure caused it to pop off</ul>
		<ul> our second prediction was proven wrong about the cold and the lid it was to cold and little to no pressure we were proven wrong</ul>
		<ul> DOl Based upon my predictions temperature can change the reactions with gas particles to hot pressure will go up and the gas will speed up to cold and the gas will slow down</ul>
		<ul><big><u> EQ: How do temperature,pressure, and volume relate to gas behavior? </u></big></ul>
		<ul> Molecules and gas have no volume and have no specific shape and there  are no attractive or repulsive forces between gas molecules</ul>
		<ul> <u>Pressure</u>=the force exerted by a substance(gas) per unit area on another surface (walls of"container")</ul>
		<ul>= gasses flow from high to low pressure</ul> 
		<ul><u>Units of measurement for pressure(at sea level)</u></ul>
		<ul>1 atm (standard atmospheric pressure)</ul>
		<ul> 101.3 kPa (kilopascals) </ul>
		<ul> 760 Hg (mm of mercury= Hg on periodic table) </ul>
		<ul> 760 torr ( named after toricelli, principle of barometer)</ul>
		<ul> 14.7 psi(pound of force per square inch)</ul>
		<ul> As temperature increeases, pressure increases</ul>
                <ul> Lussac's Law= thee pressure of a gas is directly proportional to the kelvin temperature, if the volume remains constant</ul>
